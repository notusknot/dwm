# My dwm build

This is my build of suckless's dynamic window manager.

These are the plugins I used:

- actualfullscreen: makes the fullscreen behavior better
- attachbottom: attaches new windows to the bottom of the stack instead of the top
- autostart: adds autostart functionality to set wallpaper and other things
- pertag: makes it possible to have a different layout per tag
- ru_fibonacci: adds fibonacci layout with gaps
- ru_centeredmaster: adds centered master layout with gaps
